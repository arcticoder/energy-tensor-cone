**Project Goal**: Submit a high-quality paper on the convex cone of stress-energy tensors satisfying AQEI, combining Lean formalization, computational searches, and verification against known bounds. Ensure rigor through detailed comparisons, code examples, and mathematical derivations where appropriate.

**Current Status (February 14, 2026)**: Repo at https://github.com/DawsonInstitute/energy-tensor-cone. Latest commits (e.g., `486d99f` integrating literature citations, `6bc8b51` adding methodology section and bound-comparison tests) show expanded lit review (~20 refs), enhanced testing, and TODO cleanups. PRD target PDF: `papers/aqei-cone-formalization-prd.pdf`. 

### Priority Tasks

All current priority tasks are complete. Any new work should be added here and handled via the same TODO hygiene (commit-per-task; move completed items to `docs/TODO-completed.md`; move blocked items to `docs/TODO-BLOCKED.md`).
