**Project Goal**: Submit a high-quality paper on the convex cone of stress-energy tensors satisfying AQEI, combining Lean formalization, computational searches, and verification against known bounds.

**Current Status (February 14, 2026)**: Repo at https://github.com/DawsonInstitute/energy-tensor-cone. Paper revised post-CQG rejection with expanded lit review (now ~20 refs). PRD target PDF: `papers/aqei-cone-formalization-prd.pdf`. Testing and README polishes needed for full readiness.

### Final Pre-Submission Checklist (to PRD)
- All polishes done; submit via https://authors.aps.org/Submissions/.
- Update README/sites post-submission.

### Remaining Manual Checks
- Verify manuscript length/clarity (PRD has no strict limit, but keep concise).
- Final formatting pass on `papers/aqei-cone-formalization-prd.pdf`.
