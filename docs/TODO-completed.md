# TODO-completed.md: Completed Tasks

This document tracks tasks that have been completed for the energy-tensor-cone project.

## ✅ Step 1: Verify and Complete Repository Structure (COMPLETED)

**Status:** All repository structure files exist and are functional.

**What was done:**
- Created full directory structure under `~/Code/asciimath/energy-tensor-cone/`
- All required directories present: `mathematica/`, `lean/src/`, `python/`, `tests/`
- Test scripts created and executable: `build_lean.sh`, `python_tests.sh`, `mathematica_tests.sh`, `lean_tests.sh`
- Top-level `run_tests.sh` orchestrates all tests successfully
- `README.md` created with project description
- Workspace file updated to include energy-tensor-cone

**Verification:** `./run_tests.sh` passes all tests.

## ✅ Step 2: Implement Lean lakefile and Basic Builds (COMPLETED)

**Status:** Lean project builds successfully with Mathlib integration.

**What was done:**
- Created `lean/lakefile.lean` with Mathlib dependency (pinned to v4.14.0)
- Lean 4 toolchain installed via elan
- All source files compile: `Lorentz.lean`, `StressEnergy.lean`, `AQEI.lean`, `ConeProperties.lean`, `FiniteToyModel.lean`, `AffineToCone.lean`, `AQEIFamilyInterface.lean`, `AQEIToInterface.lean`
- `lake build` succeeds
- Advanced beyond initial skeleton: proved closed/convex theorems for finite inequality systems, homogenization approach, and abstract AQEI family interface

**Verification:** `lake build` in `lean/` completes successfully.

## ✅ Step 3: Refine and Run Mathematica Search Script (COMPLETED)

**Status:** Mathematica search runs and produces results.

**What was done:**
- Implemented `mathematica/search.m` with randomized Gaussian-basis search in 1+1D Minkowski
- Script exports results to JSON: `summary.json`, `top_near_misses.json`, `near_misses.json`, `violations.json`
- Test mode uses environment variable override for fast runs (200 trials vs. default 20000)
- Successfully finds violations and near-misses as expected

**Verification:** `./tests/mathematica_tests.sh` runs search and completes successfully.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Implement Python Analyze Results and Feedback to Lean (COMPLETED)

**Status:** Python pipeline parses Mathematica output and generates Lean code.

**What was done:**
- Created `python/analyze_results.py` to parse JSON results
- Generates `lean/src/GeneratedCandidates.lean` with candidate data structures
- Created `python/orchestrator.py` to run Mathematica → Python → Lean pipeline
- Pipeline successfully generates Lean code that compiles

**Verification:** `./tests/python_tests.sh` passes, generated Lean file compiles.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Run Minimal End-to-End Test and Document Results (COMPLETED)

**Status:** Full end-to-end pipeline runs successfully with all components integrated.

**What was done:**
- Full test suite runs via `./run_tests.sh`
- Pipeline executes: Mathematica search → Python analysis → Lean generation → Lean build
- All tests pass: Python tests OK, Mathematica tests OK, Lean tests OK
- Results documented in README.md and history tracking
- Repository pushed to GitHub and publicly accessible

**Verification:** `./run_tests.sh` shows "All tests passed."

## Additional Achievements Beyond TODO Scope

**Advanced Lean Formalization:**
- Integrated Mathlib4 for formal topology and convexity proofs
- Implemented `FiniteToyModel.lean` with fully proven closedness/convexity for finite inequality systems
- Created `AffineToCone.lean` for homogenization of affine constraints into genuine cones
- Developed `AQEIFamilyInterface.lean` as abstract bridge between physics and math
- Connected `AQEI.satisfies_AQEI` to continuous linear map interface via `AQEIToInterface.lean`

**Infrastructure:**
- Fixed terminal crash issues by disabling Lean extension auto-start
- Optimized file watchers for build artifacts
- Relocated repository to correct workspace structure
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/TERMINAL_FIX.md` and `docs/history/history.md`

**Proof Progress:**
- Proved affine admissible sets are closed and convex (arbitrary index families)
- Proved homogenized cones are closed, convex, and scale properly under nonnegative scalars
- Demonstrated explicit extreme ray examples in finite-dimensional models
- Established equivalence between physics-facing AQEI constraints and math-facing continuous linear family constraints
