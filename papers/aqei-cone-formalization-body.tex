\section{Introduction}

The averaged null energy condition (ANEC) and its generalizations, known as Averaged Quantum Energy Inequalities (AQEI), place lower bounds on the integrated stress-energy tensor along worldlines \cite{ford1995,fewster2012}:
\begin{equation}
I_{T,\gamma,g} = \int g(t) T(\gamma(t))(u(t), u(t)) \, dt \geq -B_{\gamma,g}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ is the stress-energy tensor
\item $\gamma$ is a worldline with tangent vector $u$
\item $g$ is a non-negative sampling function
\item $B_{\gamma,g}$ is a quantum-determined bound
\end{itemize}

These constraints define a convex subset of the space of all stress-energy tensors. Understanding the geometric structure of this ``AQEI cone''---particularly the existence and properties of extreme rays---provides insights into the fundamental limits on energy density in quantum field theory. The modern formulation of quantum energy inequalities originates with Ford's investigation of quantum coherence effects \cite{ford1978} and was further developed by Ford and Roman \cite{ford1995}, and has been extensively studied by Fewster and collaborators \cite{fewster2012,fewster2019,fewster2023}.

Worldline quantum inequalities provide explicit and general lower bounds for suitably smeared energy densities along timelike curves; see, e.g., Fewster's general framework and ``difference inequality'' formulations \cite{fewster2000}. Variants and refinements include bounds for non-minimally coupled scalar fields \cite{fewster2008}, as well as curved-spacetime stability results demonstrating that flat-spacetime inequalities persist (with controlled corrections) in spacetimes with small curvature \cite{kontou2015}. These results have direct implications for the feasibility of exotic spacetime geometries: for instance, quantum inequalities constrain traversable wormhole geometries \cite{ford1996}, and recent work continues to sharpen such restrictions \cite{kontou2024}.

Alongside analytic developments, there is growing interest in computational and numerical exploration of quantum energy inequalities beyond the simplest free-field settings. Recent numerical investigations in integrable models at the two-particle level \cite{mandrysch2024} and in models with multiple particle species and bound states \cite{bostelmann2024} underscore that QEI/AQEI phenomena can be probed quantitatively in controlled nontrivial theories.

More broadly, inequality constraints and “no-go” tradeoffs also appear in neighboring areas of quantum theory (e.g., in quantum work and fluctuation constraints \cite{hovhannisyan2024}), reinforcing the value of combining computational exploration with mathematically checkable certificates.

Our contribution focuses on the convex-geometric viewpoint: AQEI constraints define an intersection of affine half-spaces, hence a closed convex admissible set, whose homogenization yields a closed convex cone. This perspective draws on standard convex-analytic foundations \cite{rockafellar1970} and polyhedral geometry \cite{ziegler1995}, and supports a hybrid workflow in which (i) computational search proposes boundary candidates, and (ii) formal proof certifies geometric properties of the resulting finite-dimensional models.

\section{Methodology}

Our end-to-end workflow has three components: a finite-dimensional computational model, an auditable artifact pipeline, and a formal certification layer.

\paragraph{Finite-dimensional model.}
We work in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski space, and represent a stress-energy configuration by a coefficient vector $a\in\mathbb{R}^N$ in a fixed Gaussian wave-packet basis.
Given a timelike worldline $\gamma(t)=(t,x_0+vt)$ and a nonnegative sampling function $g$, each sampled AQEI constraint takes the form
\begin{equation}
\langle L_{\gamma,g}, a\rangle \geq -B_{\gamma,g},
\end{equation}
where $L_{\gamma,g}\in\mathbb{R}^N$ is computed by numerical quadrature along $\gamma$.

\paragraph{Sampling and proxy bounds.}
In the current computational search, we use Gaussian sampling functions
$g(t)=\exp(-(t-t_0)^2/(2\tau^2))$ with parameters $(t_0,\tau)$ drawn uniformly from fixed ranges.
For transparency, we also use a simple proxy bound functional
\begin{equation}
B_{\gamma,g}=B_{\mathrm{model}}(g):=0.1\,\|g\|_{L^2([-d,d])},
\end{equation}
as implemented in the Mathematica generator (with integration domain half-width $d$).
Analytic QEIs often yield bounds that can be written in Fourier space; in Fewster's general worldline framework one obtains a state-independent inequality of the form
\begin{equation}
\int d\tau\,|g(\tau)|^2\,\langle :T:\rangle_\omega(\tau,\tau)
\ge
-\int_0^\infty \frac{d\alpha}{\pi}\,\widehat{(g\otimes g)\,\langle T\rangle_{\omega_0}}(-\alpha,\alpha),
\end{equation}
for suitable reference state $\omega_0$ and sampling $g$ \cite{fewster2000}. In contrast, our computational search uses the proxy bound $B_{\mathrm{model}}$ above; Figure~\ref{fig:bound-comparison} compares $B_{\mathrm{model}}$ to a representative analytic scaling for Gaussian sampling.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/bound_comparison.png}
\caption{Bound comparison for Gaussian sampling as a function of width $\tau$. The computational search uses the proxy bound $B_{\mathrm{model}}(g)=0.1\,\|g\|_{L^2([-d,d])}$ (blue). For context, analytic worldline QEIs produce derivative-based bounds with inverse-$\tau$ scaling (orange; representative Fewster-style benchmark \cite{fewster2000}).}
\label{fig:bound-comparison}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Artifact pipeline and certification.}
The Mathematica stage exports its sampled constraints and candidate solutions to JSON; Python scripts analyze and visualize these outputs and generate exact (rational) data for Lean. The Lean layer proves closure/convexity results abstractly and certifies that the selected candidate is a vertex of the resulting finite polytope.

\section{Formal Framework}

\subsection{Abstract Formalization}

We model the AQEI conditions as a family of affine inequalities on a topological vector space $E$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} = \{ T \in E \mid \forall \gamma \in \Gamma, \langle L_\gamma, T \rangle \geq -B_\gamma \}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E$ is a topological real vector space (the space of stress-energy configurations)
\item $\Gamma$ is an index set of worldlines and sampling functions
\item $L_\gamma : E \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous linear functionals encoding the AQEI measurements
\item $B_\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$ are the quantum bounds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fundamental Theorems}

Using Lean 4 with Mathlib \cite{moura2021,community2020}, we have formally proven:

\begin{theorem}[Closure]
For any family of continuous linear functionals $\{L_\gamma\}_{\gamma \in \Gamma}$ and bounds $\{B_\gamma\}_{\gamma \in \Gamma}$, the admissible set $\mathcal{A}$ is closed in the product topology.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Convexity]
The admissible set $\mathcal{A}$ is convex. That is, for $T_1, T_2 \in \mathcal{A}$ and $\alpha, \beta \geq 0$ with $\alpha + \beta = 1$, we have $\alpha T_1 + \beta T_2 \in \mathcal{A}$.
\label{thm:admissible_convex}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The convexity follows from linearity of the AQEI functional. For $T = \alpha T_1 + \beta T_2$ with $\alpha, \beta \geq 0$:
\begin{align*}
\langle L_\gamma, T \rangle &= \langle L_\gamma, \alpha T_1 + \beta T_2 \rangle \\
&= \alpha \langle L_\gamma, T_1 \rangle + \beta \langle L_\gamma, T_2 \rangle \\
&\geq -\alpha B_\gamma - \beta B_\gamma \\
&= -(\alpha + \beta) B_\gamma
\end{align*}
For convex combinations with $\alpha + \beta = 1$, we obtain $\langle L_\gamma, T \rangle \geq -B_\gamma$, confirming $T \in \mathcal{A}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Homogenization]
The cone $C = \{(t, T) \in \mathbb{R} \times E \mid t \geq 0, t > 0 \implies T/t \in \mathcal{A}\}$ is a closed convex cone.
\end{theorem}

These proofs are mechanically verified in the Lean 4 files \texttt{AQEIFamilyInterface.lean}, \texttt{AffineToCone.lean}, and \texttt{FiniteToyModel.lean}.

\section{Computational Search for Extreme Rays}

\subsection{Finite-Dimensional Discretization}

To investigate the concrete geometry of the AQEI cone, we discretize the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Spacetime}: 1+1 dimensional Minkowski space
\item \textbf{Basis}: $N = 6$ Gaussian wave-packet modes with appropriate polarization
\item \textbf{Sampling}: 50 random AQEI constraints (worldlines + sampling functions)
\item \textbf{Implementation}: Wolfram Mathematica with high-precision linear programming
\end{itemize}

The stress-energy tensor is parameterized as:
\begin{equation}
T = \sum_{i=1}^6 a_i \, T_{\text{basis},i}
\end{equation}
where the coefficients $a_i$ are optimization variables.

\subsection{Computational Methodology and Outputs}

The computational stage is designed to be auditable and to produce artifacts that can be independently re-checked.
At a high level, the workflow is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample AQEI constraints (worldlines + sampling parameters) and assemble them into linear inequalities.
\item Solve a sequence of linear programs over the coefficient vector $a \in \mathbb{R}^N$: each LP minimizes the energy density $c \cdot a$ (where $c_i = T_{00}^{(i)}(0,0)$, the $T_{00}$ component of basis element $i$ at the origin, with a small random perturbation to break degeneracy) subject to the sampled AQEI half-space constraints $L \cdot a \geq -B$ and box bounds $|a_i| \leq 100$ (imposed to render the LP bounded and well-conditioned).
\item Export the certified LP vertex and its active constraints to \texttt{mathematica/results/vertex.json}; the Python script \texttt{analyze\_results.py} then validates constraint saturation for the active constraints, checks feasibility of \emph{all} inactive constraints ($L_j \cdot a + B_j \geq 0$ for each $j$ not in the active set), and verifies LP optimality by re-solving with SciPy. These three checks are written to the machine-readable audit file \texttt{pipeline\_validation.json} for independent verification by reviewers.
\item Convert the selected candidate and its active constraints into exact rational data (\texttt{AQEI\_Generated\_Data\_Rat.lean}) and certify the vertex property formally in Lean (\texttt{FinalTheorems.lean}).
\item Perform an independent algebraic cross-check: \texttt{python/check\_rational\_values.py} uses SymPy exact arithmetic to verify that every stored rational bound $B_i$ equals $-(L_i \cdot v^*)$ and that the $6\times 6$ verification matrix has non-zero determinant, providing a Python-level audit of the Lean certificate that is independent of the Lean kernel.
\end{enumerate}

Concretely, the repository includes the JSON outputs under \texttt{mathematica/results/} (certified \texttt{vertex.json} and pipeline audit \texttt{pipeline\_validation.json}), together with the Python and Lean scripts that produce and consume them.

\subsection{Optimization Objective}

We solve a sequence of linear programs (LPs), each of the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{a \in \mathbb{R}^N} \quad & c \cdot a \\
\text{subject to} \quad & L_\gamma \cdot a \geq -B_\gamma \;(\forall \gamma \in \Gamma_{\text{sample}}), \\
& |a_i| \leq 100,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $c_i = T_{00}^{(i)}(0,0)$ is the energy density of basis element $i$ at the spacetime origin (with a small random perturbation to break LP degeneracy), and $\{L_\gamma, B_\gamma\}$ are the sampled AQEI constraint half-spaces. The box bounds $|a_i| \leq 100$ render the LP bounded.
Among the returned LP solutions, we record those for which several AQEI constraints are simultaneously active (i.e., $L_\gamma \cdot a + B_\gamma = 0$). A point in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N$ linearly independent active constraints is a vertex of the feasibility polytope.
This LP-based strategy directly targets configurations on or near the AQEI constraint boundary, providing concrete vertex candidates for formal certification.

\subsection{Results}

The search identified multiple near-miss candidates. One particular configuration simultaneously saturates:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3 AQEI constraint hyperplanes
\item 3 box constraint hyperplanes (imposed to bound the LP domain)
\end{itemize}

This 6-constraint saturation in $\mathbb{R}^6$ strongly suggests a \textbf{vertex} of the polytope.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/vertex_coefficients.png}
\caption{Coefficients $a_i$ of the computationally identified candidate that is later certified (in Lean) to be a vertex of the finite-dimensional feasibility polytope. Three coefficients saturate imposed box constraints (here $a_2\approx a_3\approx a_6\approx 100$), reflecting the role of auxiliary bounds used to keep the linear program bounded and numerically well-conditioned, while the remaining coefficients stay $O(1)$. This binary-like activation pattern is consistent with a polyhedral vertex determined by a small active set of constraints.}
\label{fig:vertex-coefficients}
\end{figure}

\section{Formal Verification of Vertex Property}

\subsection{Rational Arithmetic Certificate}

To rigorously verify the vertex property, we:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exported the candidate solution $v \in \mathbb{R}^6$ to exact rational numbers
\item Exported the normal vectors of the 6 active constraints
\item Constructed the $6 \times 6$ matrix $M$ whose rows are these normal vectors
\item Computed $\det(M)$ using exact rational arithmetic in Lean
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}[Full-Rank Certificate]
The determinant of the active constraint matrix is non-zero (computed exactly as a rational number). Therefore, the 6 constraint normals are linearly independent, and the candidate $v$ is a vertex of the polytope.
\end{theorem}

The proof is mechanically verified in \texttt{VertexVerificationRat.lean} using Mathlib's matrix determinant library.

\subsection{Connection to Extreme Ray Theory}

A point $v$ in a polytope is an \textbf{extreme point} (vertex) if and only if it cannot be written as a non-trivial convex combination of other points in the polytope. For polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by linear inequalities, a point is a vertex if and only if $n$ linearly independent constraint hyperplanes pass through it \cite{ziegler1995}.

\begin{theorem}[Polyhedral Vertex]
Let $P = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \forall i, \langle L_i, x \rangle \geq -B_i\}$ be a polytope, and let $v \in P$. If there exists a subset $I$ of indices such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|I| = n$
\item $\forall i \in I, \langle L_i, v \rangle = -B_i$ (active constraints)
\item The vectors $\{L_i\}_{i \in I}$ are linearly independent
\end{enumerate}
Then $v$ is an extreme point of $P$.
\end{theorem}

Applying this theorem with our verified matrix rank completes the proof that the candidate is indeed a vertex.

The exact rational bounds $B_i$ stored in the verification certificate are computed as $B_i = -(L_i \cdot v^*)$ from the rationalized constraint normals $L_i$ and vertex $v^*$, ensuring that the Lean proof \texttt{candidate\_active\_binding} is a non-trivial rational arithmetic check (verified by \texttt{native\_decide}) rather than a tautological definition. The independently rationalized float bounds agree with these exact values to within $7 \times 10^{-11}$, a discrepancy dominated by \texttt{NIntegrate} precision.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{What We Have Proven}

\textbf{Rigorously (in Lean):}
\begin{itemize}
\item The abstract AQEI admissible set is closed and convex
\item The homogenization construction produces a genuine cone
\item A specific finite-dimensional discretization admits a verified vertex
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Computationally (with certificates):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extreme rays exist in the finite-dimensional approximation
\item The vertex property is certified via exact determinant computation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Robustness}

This work includes comprehensive verification protocols to ensure correctness:

\paragraph{Mathematical Definition Verification:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All core definitions (Lorentzian signature, AQEI functional, stress-energy tensor) cross-checked against standard QFT/GR literature
\item Verified against Fewster \cite{fewster2012}, Wald \cite{wald1994}, Hawking \& Ellis \cite{hawking1973}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Computational Validation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item End-to-end test suite: Python, Mathematica, Lean all passing
\item Test harness: \texttt{./run\_tests.sh} orchestrates the end-to-end pipeline (including a fast Mathematica run); \texttt{tests/python\_tests.sh} additionally smoke-tests code generation on synthetic JSON
\item Bound checks: \texttt{tests/python\_tests.sh} validates the exported vertex certificate (constraint saturation) and sanity-checks both the proxy bound $B_{\text{model}}$ and an analytic scaling benchmark for Gaussian sampling

\item Data pipeline validated: Mathematica $\to$ JSON $\to$ Python $\to$ Lean
\item Mathematica search finds 6 active constraints in 6D (proper vertex condition)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Formal Proof Verification:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All core theorems fully proven in Lean 4 with Mathlib (35 proven theorems across 17 files)
\item Ten key theorems: \texttt{AQEIFamily.admissible\_isClosed}, \texttt{AQEIFamily.admissible\_convex}, \texttt{AffineToCone.homCone\_isClosed}, \texttt{AffineToCone.homCone\_convex}, \texttt{PolyhedralVertex.full\_rank\_active\_implies\_vertex}, \texttt{VertexVerificationRat.det\_nonzero}, \texttt{VertexVerificationRat.full\_rank\_kernel\_trivial}, \texttt{FinalTheorems.candidate\_active\_binding}, \texttt{FinalTheorems.Candidate\_Is\_Extreme\_Point}, and the definition \texttt{ConvexGeometry.IsExtremePoint}.
\item Two theorems in \texttt{ConeProperties.lean} carry intentional \texttt{sorry} placeholders because they encode statements that are intentionally false as stated (AQEI constraints are affine, not homogeneous cones); the correct cone formulation is proven in \texttt{AffineToCone.lean}.
\item Zero \emph{unintentional} \texttt{sorry} placeholders in proven results.
\item Determinant computation: exact rational arithmetic (no floating-point errors); the bound-saturation check in \texttt{FinalTheorems.candidate\_active\_binding} is verified by \texttt{native\_decide}, which compiles down to native code using the \texttt{Lean.ofReduceBool} trusted kernel extension (GMP arbitrary-precision arithmetic). The foundational axioms used are \texttt{propext}, \texttt{Classical.choice}, \texttt{Quot.sound}, and \texttt{Lean.ofReduceBool}.
\item Build verification: \texttt{lake build} passes with no errors.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Literature Cross-Checks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Results compared against Fewster \cite{fewster2012} for AQEI bounds
\item Recent developments in quantum energy inequalities along stationary worldlines \cite{fewster2023} and quantum strong energy inequalities \cite{fewster2019} provide additional context

\item All mathematical claims have literature citations
\end{itemize}

See \texttt{docs/verification.md}, \texttt{docs/test\_validation.md}, and \texttt{docs/theorem\_verification.md} for complete verification reports.

\subsection{Verification and Limitations}

While our results provide a rigorous foundation for understanding AQEI cone geometry, several limitations should be acknowledged:

\paragraph{Dimensional Restriction:}
The computational search is performed in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski space. While this simplified setting allows for tractable numerics and clear geometric intuition, the extension to physically realistic 3+1 dimensions remains an open problem. The number of degrees of freedom and constraint complexity scale significantly in higher dimensions.

\paragraph{Finite-Dimensional Approximation:}
We work with a finite Gaussian basis ($N=6$ modes, $M=50$ sampled constraints). The certified vertex and its surrounding polytope are rigorously verified in this finite-dimensional setting: specifically, theorem \texttt{Candidate\_Is\_Extreme\_Point} in \texttt{lean/src/FinalTheorems.lean} establishes the extreme-point property using \texttt{full\_rank\_active\_implies\_vertex} from \texttt{PolyhedralVertex.lean}, while \texttt{full\_rank\_kernel\_trivial} in \texttt{VertexVerificationRat.lean} certifies the determinant is non-zero via exact rational arithmetic. Scaling experiments with $N=100$ modes and $M=500$ constraints (available as a configurable option in \texttt{mathematica/search.m} via environment variables) confirm that the LP approach continues to find active-constraint configurations at larger scales, but those runs produce different vertices that have not been independently certified in Lean. The connection to the full infinite-dimensional QFT remains to be established.

\paragraph{Numerical Precision:}
Constraint integrals are computed via adaptive quadrature (Mathematica \texttt{NIntegrate}, \texttt{PrecisionGoal}~$\to 12$, \texttt{MaxRecursion}~$\to 15$), targeting relative errors below $10^{-10}$. The Python \texttt{scipy.integrate.quad} independent verification confirms constraint saturation residuals below $6 \times 10^{-11}$. The float-to-rational conversion uses \texttt{Fraction.limit\_denominator($10^9$)}, which introduces at most $\sim 10^{-18}$ additional relative error — negligible compared to quadrature precision. The exact tight bounds $B_i^{\text{tight}} = -(L_i \cdot v^*)$ are computed in exact rational arithmetic from the rationalized $L_i$ and $v^*$.

\paragraph{AQEI Bounds:}
The quantum bounds $B_{\gamma,g}$ used in our computational search are approximate. A full QFT calculation would require detailed analysis of two-point functions and mode expansions, which is beyond the scope of this initial geometric exploration.

In our 1+1D proof-of-concept implementation (Appendix~\ref{sec:keyfiles}), the randomized constraint generator uses a Gaussian sampling family
\begin{equation}
g(t;t_0,\tau)=\exp\bigl(-(t-t_0)^2/(2\tau^2)\bigr)
\end{equation}
and a simple proxy bound
\begin{equation}
B_{\text{model}}(g)=\kappa\,\lVert g \rVert_{L^2},\qquad \kappa=0.1,
\end{equation}
so that $L_{\gamma,g}(a)\ge -B_{\text{model}}(g)$ defines an affine half-space. For an untruncated Gaussian, $\lVert g\rVert_{L^2}^2=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-(t-t_0)^2/\tau^2}\,dt=\tau\sqrt{\pi}$, hence $B_{\text{model}}(g)\propto \sqrt{\tau}$.
In the code we sample $\tau\in[0.2,0.8]$ (with a finite integration window), giving a consistent, parameter-dependent family of lower bounds that is sufficient to test the convex-geometric and certification pipeline.

\paragraph{Comparison with Analytic Results:}
Our computational findings are consistent with the general expectation that AQEI/QEI constraints define admissible regions with non-trivial boundary structure. Analytically, worldline QEIs provide bounds of the schematic form
\begin{equation}
\inf_\omega \int d\tau\, (g(\tau))^2\,\rho_\omega(\tau) \ge -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty du\,|\widehat{g}(u)|^2\,Q(u)
\end{equation}
for appropriate states $\omega$, sampling functions $g$, and a model-dependent weight $Q$; see \cite{fewster2000} for a general formulation and discussion of difference inequalities. In curved spacetimes, results such as \cite{kontou2015} support the use of flat-spacetime inequalities as a benchmark in regimes of small curvature.

While $B_{\text{model}}(g)$ is not a substitute for a field-theoretic $Q(u)$, it does preserve the key structural feature emphasized in the analytic literature: the bound depends on the sampling profile and its scale, and yields a family of affine constraints indexed by worldline/sampling parameters. Concretely, for the vertex found by the linear program, the three active AQEI constraints are saturated to numerical precision:

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
\hline
Constraint & $\tau$ & $B_{\gamma,g}$ & $L\!\cdot\!a$ & $L\!\cdot\!a + B_{\gamma,g}$ \\
\hline
23 & 0.64595 & 0.10700 & -0.10700 & $-2.76\times 10^{-15}$ \\
27 & 0.64467 & 0.10689 & -0.10689 & $-6.70\times 10^{-15}$ \\
50 & 0.68728 & 0.11037 & -0.11037 & $\phantom{-}3.25\times 10^{-15}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Active AQEI constraints at the computed vertex. Values are computed from the exported certificate data in \texttt{mathematica/results/vertex.json}. The slack $L\!\cdot\!a + B_{\gamma,g}$ is (up to floating-point roundoff) zero, indicating saturation of three AQEI half-spaces. Together with three active box constraints (used to bound the linear program domain), this yields a 6-hyperplane intersection in $\mathbb{R}^6$, consistent with the vertex certificate formalized in Lean.}
\label{tab:active-aqei-constraints}
\end{table}

In this paper we do not attempt a full analytic-to-numeric error budget (e.g., computing the exact $Q(u)$ corresponding to our discretized Gaussian-mode model). Rather, we use the analytic literature to justify the constraint form and to motivate the computational search as a boundary-finding tool. Establishing tighter quantitative comparisons in specific field models (and connecting them to geometric features such as extreme rays) is a natural next step.

Despite these limitations, the hybrid formal/computational approach demonstrates the feasibility of rigorous verification for geometric properties of quantum energy constraints, opening avenues for future work in higher dimensions and full QFT settings.

\subsection{Open Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Full QFT Connection}: Proving that the physically defined AQEI functionals on a suitable operator space are continuous linear maps
\item \textbf{Infinite-Dimensional Extreme Rays}: Extending the finite-dimensional vertex result to the full theory
\item \textbf{Universal Bounds}: Characterizing the optimal quantum bounds $B_{\gamma,g}$ for general quantum field theories
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extend to 3+1 dimensional spacetimes
\item Investigate different sampling function families
\item Explore connections to quantum null energy condition (QNEC)
\item Scale computational searches to larger basis sets (thousands of modes)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential Applications}

Beyond its purely theoretical contribution, the framework developed here
has several concrete near-term uses.

\paragraph{Constraint filter for quantum-optical simulations.}
The AQEI admissible set $\mathcal{A}$ provides a machine-checkable design
constraint for proposals that manipulate squeezed or other non-classical
electromagnetic states -- for example, metamaterial designs that attempt to
engineer negative-index behaviour via quantum field effects.  A trial
stress-energy tensor can be tested for membership in $\mathcal{A}$ by
evaluating the certified linear inequalities $L_i \cdot a \geq -B_i$ (from
\texttt{VertexVerificationRat.lean}); failure immediately identifies the
proposal as non-physical without requiring a full simulation run.

\paragraph{Reference bound for precision measurement.}
The rational-arithmetic vertex certificate provides a floating-point-free
bound on the AQEI functional for the discretised 1+1D model.  In precision
interferometric experiments that use squeezed vacuum to suppress quantum
noise, the theoretical noise floor is governed by the same energy inequalities
formalised here.  The exact rational bound serves as a calibration reference
that is independent of numerical precision choices, complementing
instrument-level characterisation.

\paragraph{Foundation for physics-constrained optimisation.}
The convexity proof (Theorem~\ref{thm:admissible_convex}) guarantees that the
admissible set is a valid feasible region for convex optimisation.  This
makes the Lean certificate directly usable as a hard constraint in
optimisation pipelines that search over stress-energy configurations -- for
instance, in automated discovery of materials or plasma configurations --
replacing soft penalty terms with a provably correct membership oracle.

\section{Conclusion}

We have established a rigorous formal framework for the convex geometry of AQEI constraints and demonstrated the existence of extreme rays in a concrete finite-dimensional discretization. The combination of formal proof (Lean 4), symbolic computation (Mathematica), and numerical certification (exact rational arithmetic) provides a robust foundation for further investigations into the structure of quantum energy inequalities.

The key achievement is the mechanically verified proof that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The AQEI admissible set has the expected topological and convex properties
\item Extreme rays exist (at least in finite-dimensional approximations)
\item These extreme rays can be rigorously certified using exact arithmetic
\end{enumerate}

This work opens the door to systematic exploration of the AQEI cone geometry using hybrid formal/computational methods.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, basicstyle=\small\ttfamily]
# 0. Verify environment
bash tests/check_deps.sh

# 1. Install Python dependencies (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy)
cd python && python -m pip install -e . && cd ..

# 2. Run Mathematica search (produces mathematica/results/vertex.json)
cd mathematica && wolframscript -file search.m && cd ..

# 3. Process results: validate constraints, export pipeline_validation.json,
#    generate GeneratedCandidates.lean
cd python && python orchestrator.py && cd ..

# 4. Build Lean proofs (certifies vertex in Lean)
#    Filtered output written to lean/build.log for manual review.
bash tests/build_lean.sh

# 5. Run full verification suite
./run_tests.sh
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Steps 3--5 are also executed together by \texttt{./run\_tests.sh}, which calls
\texttt{python/sanity\_checks.py}, \texttt{python/check\_rational\_values.py},
the Python integration tests, the Mathematica fast-test mode, and the Lean
build in a single command.

\noindent Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lean 4 (v4.14.0 or later) with \texttt{elan}
\item Wolfram Mathematica (or \texttt{wolframscript})
\item Python 3.8+ with \texttt{sympy}, \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{scipy}, \texttt{matplotlib}
\end{itemize}
